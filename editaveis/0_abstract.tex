 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

     InterSCity is a smart cities platform based on a microservices
     architecture that aims at supporting smart cities applications through
     reusable, interoperable, and scalable services.
     However, InterSCity does not use suitable tools to process its data, an
     obstacle in scenarios of larger data set. This work aims to design and to
     implement a data processing service that allows InterSCity to handle
     larger data set, using mainly Big Data, a key technology for smart cities.
     With the adoption of state-of-the-art data processing architectures and
     new Big Data technologies, we expect InterSCity to be able to support more
     sophisticated applications for smart cities.
